    <p>The drive in to Yosemite National Park is lovely, but slow. There’s an astounding amount of traffic even in the national park. It’s just that much busier than we’re used to in NZ, even in touristy areas like Queenstown. There’s some massive areas that have been burnt out over the past few years, check out this photo of The Rim of the World, where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rim_Fire">the whole area was burned last year</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/rim-of-the-world.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There was a fire burning over near Half Dome when we were visiting. On the way in we drove through to Glacier Point which is where a lot of those classic Yosemite views are. Really stunning day up there, and a good view of the smoke! Hundreds of people around, it’s seriously busy in this national park.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/glacier-point.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We head back down to the valley floor to check in at Curry Village. I’d stayed at Curry Village years ago when my family and I were visiting my oldest borther in SF. It was pretty cool recognising heaps of things again after several years. Curry Village is cool, the whole tent sleeping thing is pretty rad. It’s really not somewhere to go if you want to get away from civilization though… There’s a general store with everything you need (including a pretty decent craft beer slection), 5 restaurants to choose from, and other amenities dotted around the valley floor… Not exactly roughing it.</p>

<p>We’d hoped to do a half day hike but the smoke made things a bit tricky. Instead we grabbed some bikes and spent the day riding around the valley floor. Managed to make it to the base of El Capitan, which is a pretty amazing bit of rock!</p>

<p>Yosemite… It was cool… but I think over all it was just <em>wayyyyy</em> more commercial than we expected. Of course it is though - it’s a massive national park that attracts millions of visitors a year. Somehow I think we expected a bit more magic.</p>

<p>Had a nice breakfast at The Ahwahnee Hotel before hitting the road again.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/ahwahnee.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Back into SF we go! With a couple of nights ahead we were pretty excited to do some more exploring of this unique city. Driving in SF central was interesting… hils, traffic, trams, chinatown, hazards! Made it out without a lawsuit though so that’s good!</p>

<p><strong>Ferry building market:</strong><br />
This is cool! Every day the ferry building and all of it’s awesome stores are open. Gourmet food and beverages and coffee and juice and kitchenware and all sorts of cool stuff. Krysten found this amazing GF + DF bakery that was making pretty epic Krysten-friendly treats. We hit up Blue Bottle coffee for some of the best espresso we’d had since arriving in the USA.</p>

Pineapple Guava?</p>

<p><strong>Alcatraz:</strong><br />
It’s not a trip to SF without a visit to Alcatraz eh? It’s OK. Depressing. But an interesting look at the American Penal system and it’s development over the years. The place has seen better days… and it smells like sewage.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/alcatraz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Museum De Mechanique:</strong><br />
This one is definitely worth a visit, and it’s really convenient if you’re down near Fisherman’s Wharf. It’s a collection of arcade games and machines from the last 100 years. There’s some really amazing old gizmo’s in here. It’s amazing to think that they can fix and maintain all of these. Pretty charming, and some things pretty creepy (e.g. Execution scene games… wtf? Don’t be a criminal boys and girls!).</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/museum-de-mechanique.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Off the grid:</strong><br />
This is freaking awesome! Gourmet Foodtrucks are a big thing in SF. Off The Grid runs most days and it’s where various food trucks gather at specified locations around the city. <a href="http://offthegridsf.com/">You jump online</a> and how many trucks will be where at what time. We went to one where there was about a dozen trucks serving all sorts of awesome stuff. Had an excellent burger with an Anchor Steam while listening to live jazz. This is an amazing piece of SF culture right here - love it.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/off-the-grid.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We finished our last day off with an architecture tour and guided walk which was fun. Introduced us to a few of the POPOS (Privately Owned Public Open Spaces) in central.</p>

<p>We had a Red-Eye to New York so finished off our time in SF with a beer and bite at the 21st Amendment. Great place and awesome atmosphere! It was Giant’s game day, so there was lots of orange to be seen! A great send off from SF.</p>

<p><em>Red-eye flights suck.</em> I’ll explain in the next post on New York!</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
