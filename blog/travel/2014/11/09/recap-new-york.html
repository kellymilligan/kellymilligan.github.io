    <p>What a cool time we’d had in California! Some things great, some things surprising, some things a bit depressing - but all in all, an amazing time on the west coast.</p>

<p>A big lesson at this part of the trip… Red-eye flights are awful. When flying from the west to east coast, you’re going forward in time zones. We left at 11pm, and arrived at 7am, but the flight time was only 5.5 hours. This lack of sleep took a serious toll on both of us - and arriving at JFK we weren’t feeling very well. We were soo tired, we ended up hanging around the arrivals lounge for about an hour before making a move. Unfortunately we couldn’t check into our accommodation until 5pm (!), but we were able to drop our bags off at about mid day. We managed to sort out our way into Manhattan on the train. I dozed off a couple of times on the way from Brooklyn, so thank you Krysten for being the alert one here. We arrive in the Lower East Side, a few espressos and a cream cheese bagel keeping me going until we could drop our bags.</p>

<p>New York! Manhattan! A unique city for sure. Unlike anywhere else I’ve been. No rubbish bins, patchy side walks, constant honking horns, brick buildings, quirky extremely niche stores everywhere, art galleries, pizza, hotdogs, Italian signage, brick buildings, aggressive homeless, basketball courts, CitiBike rentals, brick buildings, renovated tenements, constant construction. We only scratched the surface in our short time in Manhattan, and we’d love to go back with more time on our hands.</p>

<p><strong>Tenement Museum:</strong><br />
The Tenement Museum is an amazing look at life for working class immigrants to NY in the 19th century. It’s a city with so much history. Now most of these Manhattan tenements have been renovated into desirable (and expensive) apartments, but these guys have done a fantastic job of preserving some of them.</p>

<p>New York is a walking city, you can walk everywhere - and we did! On our second day we did this epic route:</p>

<p><strong>The High Line:</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.thehighline.org/">The High Line</a> is incredible. It’s an old, raised story rail line that runs for several miles through the western side of Manhattan. It’s been converted to a public green space, with gardens, grass areas and public viewpoints of the the city. A very unique, well executed and downright shnazzy-pants piece of urban culture. Highly recommend a visit!</p>

<p><strong>Times square:</strong><br />
Times Square is another one of those “gotta do it” attractions for a first-time visit to NY. It happened to be on the way to our next destinations, so why not! It’s pretty manic, the enormous Broadway and underwear advertising and droves of tourists complete the experience.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/newyork/times-square-day.jpg" alt="" />

<p><strong>MOMA:</strong><br />
The Museum of Modern Art is excellent. It’s expansive, and houses a lot of extremely famous pieces.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/newyork/moma.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Central Park:</strong><br />
Green! Central Park is mind-blowingly big. We only ventured into the very bottom part of it, it’s freaking huge. It needs to be, everyone in Manhattan seems to flock here, and it’s chock-full of people. Being in Central Park is an amazing look into urban living in Manhattan, people use it as a get away - even though the Skyscrapers are still all there above the tree line.</p>

<p><strong>Time Square again, and Broadway:</strong><br />
Back to Times Square, this time in the evening. The whole energy shifts when things are bathed in pink and red from the neon signage. It also gets even more busy in the evening! cranking. We catch a Broadway Show about a German tranny rockstar… The talent is amazing, the story line? a bit odd.</p>

<p>We rounded out this epic day of exploring with a fantastic NY pizza and delicious Sixpoint beers. Truly a fantastic day in NY.</p>

<p>We flew out of Newark Intl, so headed west on our last day. A bit of outlet shopping and people watching (mainly the ridiculously rude and unpleasant New Jursey folks, seriously, they seem to hate everyone and everything). Back at the airport for another red-eye to Iceland. We we’re better prepared with water and food this time though…</p>

<p>So, our time in the USA? It was cool. Not amazing, but cool. I think we imagined more magic in the most successful (you could argue… maybe influential is a better word) country in the world. There’s a <em>whole lot</em> of good in <em>all sorts</em> of places, and some really lovely people around. But there’s also a lot of things that need fixing.</p>

<p>Iceland coming up next,
Cheers!</p>
