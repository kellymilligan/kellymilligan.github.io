    <p>Why Iceland? Great question! It’s not usually one of those destinations people go out of their way to visit. It seems Iceland’s national airline (IcelandAir) have a sneaky tourism plan in place. It’s the same price to fly to Europe whether you fly direct or via Iceland. I’m glad we stopped here though, was an interesting visit.</p>

<p>First up (and touching back on the tourism comment from above), everything in Iceland is <em>crazy</em> expensive. They let their one main bank collapse back in 2008, and it sounds like it’s been pretty hard times since - but they’re slowly making their way back. It doesn’t seem like that much at 100:1 (ISK:NZD), but when you’re paying on average $25 for a meal or $10 for a beer you burn through funds <strong>fast</strong>.</p>

<p>I never realised until visiting that Iceland has a population of only 300,000. They’re doing pretty well on the world stage for such a small nation, especially in music. Maybe it’s this small population, paired with the volcanic landscape that made this place (literally on the other side of the world) feel so similar to parts of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Iceland is mainly just rocky, mossy, icey, and geothermal. There’s <em>very</em> few trees, but plenty of sheep, mountains and glaciers. It’s a massive volcanic rock riding a massive fault line (more similarities to NZ!). Volcanically, things seem significantly more lively here - theres eruptions and earthquakes that apparently occur like clockwork every few years, and things can get pretty messy!</p>

<p>The Icelandic people share some similarities to Kiwis too. They’re friendly and have a great, dry sense of humor. It was great to learn some Icelandic and Nordic history from our tour guide. Everyone speaks very fluent english (with an American accent for some reason). Everyone seems to have a great appreciation of their history, I mean, they did all used to be Vikings after all…</p>

<p>We stayed in Reykjavik for a few days - it’s a bizarre little city. It’s quite nice actually, but it’s got this odd mix of old and new. It’s really developed, but it’s small. It’s very cultural, but only in a small area in the centre of town. There’s very little food culture, especially on a budget. It has this really odd sort of “ghost-town” feeling to it since it’s so quiet when it feels like it should be busy.</p>

<p>We went for a day trip to find a hot-water stream and climb on a glacier, was pretty epic! Pretty expensive, but really glad we did it. I’ll just let the photos do the talking:</p>

<p>Another cool stop on this great trip. Next stop, my final destination. Onward to Amsterdam!</p>
