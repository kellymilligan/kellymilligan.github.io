    <p>Here we are in charming Amsterdam!</p>

<p>Krysten was here for about a week before heading back to NZ. Here’s what we got up to before she left, and a little bit from the following couple of weeks.</p>

<p>We got in on a Thursday evening and checked into our hotel. A beautiful warm Amsterdam evening. Hungry after the flight we strolled down to Leidseplein to find some dinner and a beer. Leidseplein is one of the biggest party areas in Amsterdam, full of bars, beer cafe’s, restaurants, clubs, and coffeeshops. Things get pretty crazy in the early hours, but earlier in the evening it’s just a great friendly, busy atmosphere. We grab bite then a La Chouffe at a busy outside bar.</p>

<p>On Friday we did some exploring on foot. It was really a day of just taking in the city for a bit. We met up with my new workmates on Friday afternoon for a few beers which was lots of fun.</p>

<p>On Saturday we jumped on a train up to Groningen to visit some of Krysten’s family. It was lovely to meet them, and they took great care of us for the weekend. Groningen is a very interesting city too, it’s typically Dutch. It has charming green areas and waterways, even though they’re all man-made (more on this later).</p>

<p>We got back to Amsterdam around noon on Sunday. We hired a couple of bikes and started exploring the city again. Biking here is awesome! There’s <strong>so many</strong> bikes… But, there’s far fewer road vehicles than you’d expect. This makes it a blast getting around, since you can basically get anywhere you need on the bike. Getting the bell every now and then doesn’t feel so bad, we were just 2 more of the shedloads of tourists with hired bikes! You get the hang of the bike traffic pretty quickly, then you’re sailing. Amsterdam is a city teeming with activity. So many tourists from all over the world, drunk english stag parties, people loving the coffeeshop culture, awesome markets, museums, gorgeous canals full of tour boats, rad boutique shops, busy food places, outside bars, and loads more! It’s busy (nothing compared to New York though) but still relaxed and with a great atmosphere.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we cycled over the Eastern side of the rings to check out Brouerij ‘t IJ (pronounced “Brow-er-aye et-aye”). It’s one of the bigger craft breweries here in Amsterdam, and they make some great beers. Their IPA is especially good, and one that I’ve enjoyed several times when I’m craving hops. The brewery has a big tasting room and beer garden that always seems to be pumping. They’ve got all of their beers on tap plus a couple of seasonals (Session IPA while were were there, again, was great!). The only food they serve is cheese cubes and peanuts, but these both go awesomely with beer! It’s a pretty Dutch thing to get cheese cubes as bar food, often with mustard. We left with a nice buzz and enjoyed biking around in the late afternoon sun.</p>

<p>I started work at Resn on the Monday. It’s been great getting stuck in here. A fantastic team full of very talented passionate individuals, and amazing projects that are challenging, interesting and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Krysten was around until Thursday, so she did some exploring while I was at work. Sounds like she had an awesome time checking out some museums and the Red Light. Was lovely having her around after work to share some classic Dutch cuisine! Thursday came around and we had a pretty tough goodbye at the Airport… Only 3 months until I’d be home for Christmas! :-(</p>

<p>The following weekend I caught up on exploring the city. I had a great time biking around, and visited a couple of museums. The Rijksmuseum is <em>very</em> impressive. Here’s some photos!</p>

<p>Amsterdam is such a cool city. There’s some really cool stuff that I’ll split into separate blog posts, coffee culture (the beverage kind…), beer events, brewery visits, bikes, canals, music events, the Dutch, and lots more.</p>

<p>To finish off, here’s some other photos of Amsterdam:</p>
