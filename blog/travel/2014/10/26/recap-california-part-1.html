    <p>LAX! You always hear about how manic it is… After watching 2 movies and our eye-lids over the course of 11 hours we were ready to tackle the USA! Pleasantly surprised by the pleasantness of the customs process (we’d heard horror stories…) we stepped outside - instantly realizing we’re lost in the mini-city that is LAX. Found the bus to the car rental, then we were on the road to Venice Beach!</p>

<p>Venice beach is a real spectacle. It kinda typifies California. The skateboards, the homeless folks, the street performers, the constant haze of smog and smoke. The whole beach drag consists of alternating novelty clothing, smoking utensil, and 99c pizza/$7 fresh fruit stores. It’s entertaining just wandering up and down people watching.</p>

<p>With a group from the hostel, we rented bikes and rode down to Santa Monica pier at sunset. Live music, food carts and shitloads of people - a typical Venice Beach Thursday :)</p>

<p>We grabbed a quick beer at a craft beer place just across the street from the hostel. Ballast Point Sculpin, way fresher than I’ve ever had in NZ and oh man it was good.</p>

<p>We only had 1 night in LA, hitting the road again first thing in the morning. Stoked to find a rad coffee place just over the road! Who says <em>all</em> American’s like shitty coffee? Stopped at WholeFoods to stock up on road trip supplies.</p>

<p>Behold a regular WholeFoods beer fridge:

(Sweet jesus!)</p>

<p>On the road, and up the coast on highway #1 toward Montery for the night. It’s pretty awesome driving up this coastal highway. We stopped a few places on the way but honestly - there’s not a whole lot in between. Every 10 minutes you see a massive shopping complex with all of those big American brands. Every 3 minutes you pass by a selection of crappy fast food options. Things thin out quite a bit but also get more interesting as you get further north. Morro Bay, Big Sur, Cambria, and Carmel are all pretty charming.</p>

<p>Montery is this funny little city on the coast. It’s <em>quaint</em>, but still crazy developed. We went for a stroll into town to find a massive live music and farmers market cranking down by Fisherman’s Wharf. Further down Fisherman’s Wharf you run across a multitude of Seafood Restaurants (all offering a free taster of their chowder), <em>Novelty</em> Candy shops (specifically saltwater taffy and candy apples), and nautical trinket stores. Bizarrely commercialized - but so is everything in the USA ;) Had dinner and beers at this little brewpub called Peter B’s. Great beers including a nice oaked IPA.</p>

<p>We hit the road again the next day on the way to San Francisco. Continued on the coast to Santa Cruz then cut inland. Keen to get to SF as early as possible we didn’t make any detours. Getting into SF is pretty chaotic! Nek level traffic issues - but GPS was our friend.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/road-to-sf.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next challenge was finding a park - which is a big one in SF! Found a parking building then went for a wander around the Mission District until we could check in to our accommodation. Delores Park is this rad park in the Mission, it’s packed with people on a nice day no matter what time it is. Checked in and had a chat to our airbnb hosts, then went for a wander around the surrounding neighborhoods. There’s some awesome shops and sights in SF, really cool city with an amazing atmosphere. Had a few beers with our lovely hosts before heading out to a music gig at The Chapel - An epic first evening in SF.</p>

<p>We only had 1 night in SF before heading further north, returning the following week for another couple of nights. We were on the road again heading up to Sacramento. We’ve got a friend in Sacramento who we met back at Uni. The further north you get the more dusty and brown the landscape gets! It’s pretty desert like up near Sacramento, and we were loving the 28c heat.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/posts/california/map-sf-to-sacramento.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We didn’t see a whole lot of Sacramento, but it seems nice, classic California. Big agricultural city with orchards and farms in many surrounding areas. Checked out a couple of wineries with our hosts and had an awesome time exploring in lazy late-summer sunny bliss.</p>

<p>Only 4 days in and we’d already explored so much of California. Onwards to Yosemite! Yosemite and then back to SF coming in my next post.</p>
