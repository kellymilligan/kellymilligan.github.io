    <p><strong>Hi everyone!</strong></p>

<p>So this is my first blog post (finally!). In this post I’ll be turning the camera on Kelly and showing some photos of him instead of just me all the time! I’m generally the one in photos because of Kelly’s thief-proof method of camera-carrying when we are traveling. I mean it’s successful…. but makes it a complicated process to get my hands on the camera. Ah well.</p>

<p>The last 7 months have been fun and busy! We’ve had so many more visitors than I expected from NZ and Australia, it’s been awesome.</p>

<p>Here’s a couple of my favourite things about Amsterdam / NL:</p>

<p><strong>Number 1</strong>: Living across the road from a large park.
You really get a sense of the seasons and there’s a bike highway that runs through the middle, so you are always reminded of where you are.</p>

<p><strong>Number 2</strong>: Biking…everywhere!
What can I say, the last time I used a bike as a primary mode of transport I was 10 and biking to intermediate school. It’s so much fun! And it’s like getting free exercise, because you don’t really notice it - you’re too busy enjoying the breeze, the sights… and racing Kelly home!
(note: I’ll let you know if this ranking falls when it’s &lt;0 degrees outside…)</p>

<p><strong>Number 3</strong>: Live music alllll the time… everywhere!
So many bands I like regularly pass through Amsterdam that it’s super easy to see them. We’ve been to a few already and have big plans.</p>

<p><strong>Number 4</strong>: Organic is everywhere and it’s not <em>that</em> expensive!
I do honestly love this. There are at least 4 restaurants near our house that are focused on using organic ingredients from local farmers with sustainable practices. There’s also an equivalent of Huckleberry farms and Nosh &lt;10min away. So gooood! Oh and did I mention… my work has a cafeteria that serves heaps of organic, local food (!).</p>

<p>I have curated a few of my favourite photos from over the past 7 months…. Wow….it’s already been 7 months! I really need to level-up on Duolingo :P</p>

We were invited by a kiwi friend of a friend to play Kick-ball in a local park - this is Kelly getting ready to steal second base! We ended up joining the team and having heaps of fun - and quadrupled the amount of kiwis we know in Amsterdam!

The answer is yes.

<p>Lots of love and hugsss!!<br />
