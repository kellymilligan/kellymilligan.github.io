    <p>I’ve had a good time exploring the beer scene since I’ve arrived here. New Zealand’s beer scene is so bangin right now, I wasn’t sure how well it’d compare over here. It’s not quite as good as NZ’s scene (just in my own opinion of course), there’s much more tradition and a bit less innovation. The easy access to proper Belgian Lambics is really amazing though.</p>

<p>A few weekends after I landed there was a <a href="http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/Ndtrc/PINT%20Bokbierfestival">Bokbier Festival</a>. Bokbier (Bock) is massive here, it’s their autumn seasonal and it seems <em>every</em> <strong>single</strong> brewery from the Netherlands brews one. They’re quite nice - but can get a bit much after more than a couple in a sitting. They’re malt forward, with a little bit of roast. Some nice cocoa and coffee characters. The ones that are on the sweeter side get a bit cloying. The craft brewers tend to make them quite a bit hoppier than the styleguides would suggest, but I feel like it actually makes for a more balanced beer that way. This festival is entirely dedicated to the style, with all of the beers being poured belonging the Bock family (also includes Doppelbock and stuff too).</p>

<p>They’ve been running the event for ages (way back in 1978 and grown to quite an impressive size now), and it seems to run pretty flawlessly. You can bring in food and snacks, non-alchy drinks, chilly bins, camping tables/chairs - people in our circle even brought in their adorable dog Tesla. It’s so much more relaxed than events in NZ! Maybe it’s a drinking culture difference thing… There’s some stuff we could learn from, like the epic glass washing stations that you can use between fills. The food they sell at the event is pretty sweet, and pretty dutch! Going to the bathroom costs 50c (per visit!) - I guess that’s a good way to front the cleaning bill! Interestingly, they use loads and loads of plastic kegs rather than stainless.</p>

<p>The best way to show you the event is through photos… Here’s a bunch!</p>

<p>And, as always in this city, all you need to do is bike home ;)</p>

<p>Over all, great event! Had a cool time, tried some nice beers, and managed to learn quite a bit more about the brewing market here.</p>

<p>Cheers!<br />
