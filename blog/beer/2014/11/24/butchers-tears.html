    <p>Now that I’ve caught up on my recap posts it’s time for the fun stuff! These next few are still going to recapping stuff from the last couple of months, but they’re much more about <em>living</em> in Amsterdam, rather than traveling here!</p>

<p><strong>Butcher’s Tears</strong><br />
<a href="http://butchers-tears.com/">http://butchers-tears.com/</a></p>

<p>Butcher’s tears is a craft brewery here in Amsterdam. They’re a bit out of the way, but their area is so quiet and randomly ghost-townishly charming it’s kinda awesome. Still only about 10-15m by bike to get there (like everything here!) so it’s no biggy.</p>

<p>They’ve got a pretty solid stable of beers, including quite a few of the hoppiest I’ve tried since I’ve been here. This is great, because with all of this big, sweet Belgian beer floating around here - an aggressively hopped IPA is just what I’ve been craving. Over all the beer is very good, some is just a touch hot. I think they could maybe pay a little bit more attention to yeast health to get it the rest of the way there.</p>

<p>From what I understand, they’re currently contract brewing in Belgium - but they’ve got their own brewhouse in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Their tasting room is pretty awesome, it’s all white tiles with odd wooden bench-tables. The illustrations incorporated into the brand (and in random places around the tasting room) are really interesting. They open up a big roller door during the day and you can sit outside in a really relaxed car-park style outdoor area. I first visited soon after I arrived here - it was an unseasonably sunny 20c day and it was lovely sitting outside having a chat. Peanuts and cheese cubes with mustard are the food options, and again, these are both wonderful beer snacks!</p>

<p>I’ll definitely be keeping a close eye on this place as they shift over to the new brewhouse!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
